# MiniquizApp
This app is an inspiration drawn from a recent drama I watched, "Strangers from hell". It was so good I had to make this to help people understand the summary and the different character potray in the show. There is also a small quiz for the viewer to find out which character they are!

# Concluding thoughts
This projects has taugh me alot about flutter development. I had fun and there are definitely things to be improved on.

Things that can be improved on:
- Question 3 where the red wine image takes abit too long to pop up
- Quiz transition can be smoother without all those extra colours and floating button.
